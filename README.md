https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf,_goat_and_cabbage_problem

A farmer with a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage must cross a river by boat.
The boat can carry only the farmer and a single item. 
If left unattended together, the wolf would eat the goat, 
or the goat would eat the cabbage. 
How can they cross the river without anything being eaten?

A weak GA solution.
